<h2>STATE AID FOR MATRIMONY.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a University Extensionist.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;What a charming little
theatre that is at Burlington House! I missed
you at the <i>matinées</i> there a few days ago. Of
course you know the Travelling Provincial
Company of the Universities&#39; Guild for the
Extension of High-Class Comedy? Well,
they visited the Metropolis for their coming-of-age,
and gave the new extravaganza of
<i>Hodge, B. Sc.</i>, or <i>The Vision of Peers and
the Plowman</i>. This had nothing to do with
<i>Jupiter, LL. D.</i>, though no fewer than three
noble Chancellors took a leading part at the
different performance. After all it was
nothing but a dished-up version of the old
play of <i>Gentleman Geordie</i>, or <i>The Cultured
Collier</i>; only the pitman business is a little
played out, and the victim of Agricultural
Enlightment is just now the vogue, thanks to
the County Councils.</p>

<p class="indent">But what interest, you will say, <i>can</i> this
weary work have for &quot;the young person&quot; (is
not that the phrase?). Why should <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>
and I and the other country cousins, who are
up to have a good time, waste our precious
moments on University Extension, when they
might have been given to the galleries, or,
better still, to the shops? Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
you will not betray my confidence and print
my real name, <i>will</i> you, if I tell you the
reason? I do so in the hope that you will
use your great and good influence to support
our claim for State aid in a matter deeply interesting
us girls in the provinces.</p>

<p class="indent">I have always thought that the most
important object of University Extension
has been overlooked. It certainly was the
other day. I mean this. In the present
unparalleled depression of the matrimonial
market, what we want is a constant supply
of nice, eligible young men from the University
&quot;brought home to our very doors,&quot; as
they say about culture and the people. We
cannot <i>all</i> live in garrison towns, and what
are two or three curates among so many?
Already, as I have seen in one of the magazines
for young ladies, the cleric cloth is
being supplanted in romantic fiction by the
lay lecturer&#39;s velveteen. But we must have
State said, and, if necesary, create a fresh
Government Department, for the increase
and support of this class of men. The profession
would be very popular; those who
joined it would keep marrying and moving
on (I hope I express myself intelligently),
and there would soon be enough to go round.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ethel&#39;s</span> papa, who is not very rich, and has
a large family, told her that people in Rome
who married, and had three children, got a
sort of degree for it, and were let off taxes.
It seems to me that the scheme for State aid
which I suggest is a much more modest one.</p>

<p class="indent">A man that played the title-rôle in <i>Hodge,
B. Sc</i>., gave vent to what I considered a very
stupid sentiment. &quot;Give us,&quot; he said,
&quot;some really useful and sensible instruction,
not silly lectures about Love and Marriage,
just to make people laugh!&quot; This only
shows how dreadfully void of finer feeling is
your man of Agricultural Enlightenment.
Why, we once had a <i>delightful</i> course on
almost the very subjects at which he was
ignorantly pleased to scoff! It was given by
an interesting-looking young graduate from
St. Valentine&#39;s, and was called &quot;Byron and
Shelley, with dissolving views.&quot; I remember
well the questions set by him for one of
the weekly papers. Shall I repeat them?
He had just been lecturing on <i>Don Juan</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">1. Give in alphabetical order the chief attractions
of the Hero of our poem.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Cite parallels to <i>Don Juan</i> among the
gentleman friends of your acquaintance <i>other
than Extension Lecturers</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Contrast the character (if any) of <i>Haidee</i>
with that of (<i>a</i>) <i>The Maid of Athens</i>,
(<i>b</i>) <i>Queen Mab</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">I took a lot of pains over this paper, and I
sent the lecturer an anonymous button-hole,
with a request (in the same handwriting as
on the answer-paper) that he would wear my
floral tribute at lecture. He did so, and expressed
himself as greatly pleased with my
work. On my exercise (which I have kept)
he wrote the following observation:&mdash;&quot;Excellent;
most appreciative and womanly; I
thank you; should like to discuss a small
question with you after class.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now we want more of this spirit among
Extension Lecturers. True, the one of whom
I spoke turned out afterwards to have been
married all the time, and I <i>do</i> think he should
have mentioned it on the cover of his syllabus;
but the principle holds good just the same.</p>

<p class="indent">So, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, on this question of
State aid, at which I have (as I hope with
delicacy) hinted above, you <i>will</i> help us, won&#39;t
you?</p>

<p class="right">Your devoted,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Madge</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">P.S.&mdash;Couldn&#39;t <i>you</i> lecture to us on something
nice, and help to raise a fund for our
scheme?</p>

<h2>YET ANOTHER MEMOIR OF NAPOLEON.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;There are so many
lives of the great <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> being published
nowadays that one might fancy the former
ruler of France must have been as many-careered
as a cat. Still, it may be interesting
to your readers if I give a few particulars of
the great man that have not yet appeared in
print, if I except the pages of your own immortal
volumes.</p>

<p class="indent">I had the pleasure of meeting the great
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> some forty or fifty years ago; he was
then in his prime.</p>

<p class="indent">In personal appearance he was not unlike
the portraits so familiar to the public. In
spite of his enthusiastic devotion for France,
he invariably addressed his troops in the
English language. This is a characteristic
that seemingly has escaped the attention of
all his biographers.</p>

<p class="indent">The numbers and quality of his army have
been much exaggerated. Although in his
speeches he was accustomed to boast of the
strength of his troops, as a matter of fact
they could be more easily counted by tens than
hundreds. His artillery was almost a myth,
and the ammunition was chiefly composed of
crackers. As for his cavalry, the horses were
showy but unreliable, many of them had white
spots, and not a few were extremely intelligent.
His favourite charger had been known
on occasion (when engaged in circus duty) to
drink a glass of sherry with the clown.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is one point I particularly wish
to set right. Although known by the public
as <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span>, my hero in private
life was invariably called by his intimates
&quot;poor old <span class="smcap">Gomersal</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">Yours respectfully,</p>
<p><i>The Amphitheatre</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Boswell Redivivus</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Within Site of Astley&#39;s.</i></p>

<p class="indent">P.S.&mdash;I saw the latest actor&#39;s edition of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> the other night at the Gaiety. He
wasn&#39;t &quot;in it&quot; with &quot;<span class="smcap">Gomersal</span>,&quot;&mdash;but then
<span class="smcap">Gomersal</span> was occasionally on horseback; still,
there was the uniform and the snuff-box.</p>

away from your beloved billiards already? <i>Quite</i> wonderful!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bertie Pilliner.</i> It&#39;s too <i>horrid</i> of you to leave us to play all by

<p class="indent"><i>Archie Bearpark</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Bertie Pilliner</span>). You speak for yourself,
<span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>. <i>I</i> didn&#39;t come to be petted.
Came to see if Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> wouldn&#39;t
come and toboggan down the big
staircase on a tea-tray. <i>Do!</i> It&#39;s
clinkin&#39; sport!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If there&#39;s
one thing I <i>can&#39;t</i> stand it&#39;s a rowdy

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Ta muchly, dear boy,
but you don&#39;t catch me travellin&#39;
downstairs on a tea-tray <i>twice</i>&mdash;it&#39;s
just a bit <i>too</i> clinkin&#39;, don&#39;t you know!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Archie</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Why, there &#39;s
a mat at the bottom of the stairs!
Well, if you won&#39;t, let&#39;s get up a

<p class="indent"><i>Bertie.</i> I beg to oppose. Do let&#39;s
show <i>some</i> respect for the privacy of
the British hunter. Why should I go
and smack them on their fat backs,
and feel every one of their horrid legs
twice in one morning? I shouldn&#39;t

failures, the Hampton Court Bridge was shot yesterday evening by
a young man, supposed to be an Anarchist, whose name and address
remain a profound secret, as, owing to his having taken his outrigger
by the hour, and, having paid his shot, there was no excuse for his
detention by the assistants in charge of the boats. He had been
dining freely at a neighbouring hostelrie, the sign of which being
&quot;The Mitre,&quot; suggested to the intelligent detective in charge of the
case the probability of the wretched youth being a &quot;dîne-à-mitre.&quot;
Furnished with this clue, the police are on his track. Fortunately
the bridge escaped without injury, and this morning it not only
crossed the river itself without difficulty, but assisted many travellers
to do the same.</p>

<h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;">
<a href="images/017.png"><img width="100%" src="images/017.png" alt="" /></a> <p>L&#39;Attaque du Moulin (à poivre)</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">It strikes me forcibly that the Wagnerian idea has influenced all
recent compositions. Nothing is now done without a &quot;motive.&quot; It
may be a good motive, or a bad motive, or an inadequate motive, or
an indifferent motive; but motive there must be with our most modern
school of composers, who, adopting the Wagnerian idea, (not in itself
a purely original one,) and improving on it, attribute less importance
to the &quot;Act&quot; than to the &quot;motive,&quot; though by a reflex action the
scheme of the Act suggests, organises, and it may be added, orchestrates
the &quot;motives.&quot; <i>L&#39;Attaque du Moulin</i> is a practical example
of this theory. It is
not styled an opera
but a lyric drama in
four acts. It is founded
by <span class="smcap">M. Louis Gallet</span>
on <span class="smcap">Zola&#39;s</span> story; it is
reduced to plain English
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Weatherly</span>;
the music is by <span class="smcap">Alfred
Bruneau</span>; and for the
stage management,
which has so largely
conduced to its success,
Sir <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus</span>
is responsible.
It is not what the
sporting papers term
&quot;a merry mill,&quot; though
there is plenty of fighting.
There <i>are</i> some
songs in it, and there
are some melodies&mdash;or
mill-odies&mdash;which
may catch on when heard a second or third time; but they certainly
do not arrest the attention at a first hearing. The music, I judge
only from the one representation, seems lacking in those catching-on
airs which, coupled with the admirable acting of the principals,
made the fortune, <i>sur le champ</i>, of the <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>. But
a &quot;wind-mill&quot; without any &quot;air&quot; can&#39;t be expected to &quot;go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame <span class="smcap">Delna</span> is forcibly dramatic, true, but not powerful as a
singer, at least in Covent Garden. Nor is there in the character of this
Maid of the Mill any such great opportunity whereby to test the power
of the actress as there is in the part of <i>Santuzza</i>, or of <i>Anita</i>
in <i>La Navarraise</i>. Madame <span class="smcap">Delna</span> may be all that enthusiastic reporters
have said she is, but she must have a great deal of power in
reserve, for the display of which this opera does not offer the chance.
Mons. <span class="smcap">Bouvet</span> as <i>Merlier</i>, the Miller, who &quot;created&quot; the part in Paris,
is good, but his acting is somewhat monotonous. Madame <span class="smcap">de Nuovina</span>
as <i>Françoise</i>, is a young <i>Lady Macbeth</i>, who gives the dagger
and does not request that it may be returned to her again when done
with. <span class="smcap">M. Bonnard</span>, as the <i>Singing Sentinel</i>, reminding me of
<span class="smcap">Gilbert</span> and <span class="smcap">Sullivan&#39;s</span> <i>Sentinel</i> &quot;with a song&quot; in one of the Savoy
Series, was very good; and Mons. <span class="smcap">Cossira</span>, excellent as the escaping
prisoner, bore so strong a resemblance to the Director of the Fortunes
of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, that people looked twice at their
programmes in order to be quite sure that an apology for the singer
had not been made, and that the much-talented Sir <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> had
not, at the shortest possible notice, consented to be his &quot;<i>remplaçant</i>.&quot;
Mons. <span class="smcap">Albers</span>, as the <i>German Captain</i>, ought to be in receipt of a
very large salary, seeing &quot;how wide he opens his mouth&quot; when
singing. All were good in the best of all possible operatic entertainments,
including the unequalled orchestra conducted by <span class="smcap">M. Ph.
Flon</span>, (is this &quot;Phlon-<span class="smcap">Flon</span>&quot;?) who has taken his turn with Signori
<span class="smcap">Bevignani</span>, <span class="smcap">Mancinelli</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederic Cowen</span>, the last-mentioned
coming to look after his new Opera of <i>Signa</i>, in which
Madame <span class="smcap">de Nuovina</span> was charming, and Signor <span class="smcap">Benjamino Davieso</span>
appeared as the Anglo-Italian Tenor. Congratulations to Signor
<span class="smcap">Frederico Coweni</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Saturday night.</i> <i>Elaine.</i> &quot;If it&#39;s not very lively,&quot; observes Sir
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> beforehand, &quot;still it must be remembered that I have
not only at heart the interests&mdash;and in pocket the interest&mdash;of Covent
Garden, but also of &#39;<i>Drear Elaine</i>.&#39; Should it prove a joyous opera
and attract the people, then I shall consider it as an example of
&#39;Drawer-Elaine&#39; at Covent Garden. But now&mdash;hark!&mdash;let us not
trifle with time and tune. <span class="smcap">Mancinelli</span> is raising his <i>bâton</i>, up goes
the curtain, and all in to begin. <i>Nous verrons.</i>&quot; And the &quot;all&quot;
includes the Prince and Princess of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> and their two unmarried
daughters, and a very good house indeed. &quot;And how is <i>Elaine</i>?&quot;
is the question. &quot;Very well, thank you, and much better than she
was two years ago,&quot; is the reply. <i>Elaine</i> is decidedly thinner. One
Act gone, and other judicious cuts have reduced her. The opera is
consequently lighter. Due weight, however, is given to it by
Madame <span class="smcap">Melba</span> and <span class="smcap">Jean de Reszké</span>. <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> has followed
the precedent of &quot;cutting the &#39;osses.&quot; But the &quot;cackle&quot; of geese
followeth not. On the contrary, the applause is abundant.</p>

<h2>A PUFF AND A BLOW.</h2>

<p class="indent">Should tropical weather continue, let dusted,
wooden-pavemented, sore throated, weary Londoner,
take train Sunday Morning 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Victoria,
or rather let train take <i>him</i>, right away
to Dover, where he will at once step on board
the <i>Calais-Douvres</i>, and get one hour and a
quarter&#39;s worth of ozone into his system. Then
at 2.15 he will land at Calais, when, free of
baggage, wraps, and all such-like <i>impedimenta</i>,
he will walk into the buffet of the
hotel, and having made his choice from many
excellent things there set before him, he will
proceed to walk into his <i>déjeuner à la
fourchette</i>, for which meal he will have
ample time, seeing that the <i>Calais-Douvres</i>
does not start on its return voyage till 3.45.
After <i>déjeuner</i> comes the <i>fourchette</i>, or &quot;fork
out,&quot; which, if the voyageur be wisely content
with the <i>ordinaire</i>, will amount to a
very moderate sum. Then, exclaiming with
the ancient pirate of bye-gone nautical melodrama,
&quot;Once aboard the lugger and we are
free,&quot; he will saunter, leisurely, with cigar,
pipe, or cigarette, according to the taste and
fancy of the smoker, down to the boat.
There, if he be wise and wary, he will at once
re-embark, in order to secure a comfortable
arm-chair in a good position, long before any
trains bearing hot and dusty travellers from
Belgium or Paris shall appear. There he can
sit, smoking calmly under a cool sunshade,
placidly watching the shooting of the luggage,
which is unattended by any danger,
each box going off with a very slight noise,
and he can calmly wonder at the anxiety of
the passengers. Then, farewell France, welcome
back to the shores of Old England, and
the adventurous Briton will find himself
landed at Victoria Terminus by 7.15 or it may
be 7.20, with another ozonised appetite, ready
for a dinner <i>chez lui</i>,&mdash;or <i>chez</i> anybody who&#39;ll
give him one,&mdash;and afterwards, sufficiently
tired, neither fagged nor weary, he will be
certain of a good sleep at an early hour, and
sure to wake in the morning all the better and
fresher for his outing and his inn-ing.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Delightful book,&quot; quoth
the Baron, &quot;is <i>David Garrick</i>,
written by my worthy friend,
<span class="smcap">Joseph Knight</span>, F.S.A. Let me
recommend this work as one to be
placed by your reading chair, and
to be taken up, as was <i>Mrs.
Gamp&#39;s</i> bottle, when so dispoged,
and oftentimes will you thus enjoy
a Knight with <span class="smcap">Garrick</span>.&quot; One
of the most humorous among very
many anecdotes in this book is
that about <span class="smcap">Boswell</span> going to the
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> Fête costumed as a
Corsican, within his pocket a poem
he had written for the occasion,
and &quot;which,&quot; says Mr. <span class="smcap">Knight</span>
simply, &quot;he intended to speak,
but the crowd would not suspend
its diversions to hear him.&quot; That&#39;s
all: but isn&#39;t it delightful! Poor
<span class="smcap">Bozzy</span>!!</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron is more than pleased
to see once again the deft hand of
Mr. <span class="smcap">T. H. S. Escott</span> at work in
reviews and magazines. His paper,
entitled &quot;Edmund Yates, an Appreciation
and a Retrospect,&quot; is
most interesting to the Baron, who
can call to mind the persons he
mentions in literary and journalistic
connection with <span class="smcap">Edmund
Yates</span>&mdash;though the Baron does not
happen to remember them in this
particular connection, but as a
band of brothers quite apart, and
all of them younger by some years
than <span class="smcap">Edmund Yates</span>, who, at the
time <span class="smcap">Hood</span>, <span class="smcap">Prowse</span>, <span class="smcap">H. S. Leigh</span>
and others were commencing, had
made his name in literature, was
<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens&#39;s</span> henchman,
and had been also more or less successful,
in combination with a Mr.
<span class="smcap">Harrington</span>, as a dramatist. The
time I speak of is when <span class="smcap">H. J.
Byron</span> &quot;flourished,&quot; and when
&quot;all the world was young.&quot; <i>The
World</i> itself, of course, not having
been born or thought of. Looking
back to those days the Baron
thinks that Mr. <span class="smcap">Escott</span> does himself
an injustice, and that he is
younger than he thinks he is. Be
this as it may, he will in any case
have a stock of pleasant memories
to draw upon, and now, if his
health permit, all will look forward
to what he cannot look
forward to himself, <i>i.e.</i>, his reminiscences.
&quot;<i>Prosit!</i> Mr.

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 2.</i>&mdash;&quot;I am sorry,&quot; said Cap&#39;en
<span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span>, &quot;that there is no <span class="smcap">Chatham</span>, <span class="smcap">Burke</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fox</span> alive
at this moment to resist this project of taxing the Colonies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In their unavoidable absence the <span class="smcap">Cap&#39;en</span>, contrary to his custom,
offered a few remarks. It had been just as well if he had omitted
the preliminary one. He really did not mean anything, much less
did he desire deliberately to offend his friends <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, <span class="smcap">Butcher</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Byrne</span>. But, as the poet remarks, Evil is wrought by want of
thought, and the invidiousness of <span class="smcap">Tommy&#39;s</span> remark lost nothing of
sting because he had not intended to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings&mdash;except,
of course, those of <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>, and that is a legitimate
occupation. When an enthusiastic female admirer observed to the
eminent <span class="smcap">Whistler</span> that he and <span class="smcap">Velasquez</span> were the two greatest
artists of times ancient or modern, <span class="smcap">Jemmy</span> modestly observed, &quot;Why
drag in <span class="smcap">Velasquez</span>?&quot; Thus <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, <span class="smcap">Butcher</span>, and <span class="smcap">Byrne</span> turned
upon <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> with reproachful glance and murmured, &quot;Why drag
in <span class="smcap">Chatham</span>, <span class="smcap">Burke</span>, and <span class="smcap">Fox</span>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, all over now. The midnight bells chiming over sultry
London proclaim passing of Budget Bill through Committee. Been
a long hard fight, monotonous in its continuity, occasionally exciting
in its divisions, continuously illustrative of Englishman&#39;s faculty of
never knowing when he&#39;s beaten. Honours rest with <span class="smcap">Squire of
Malwood</span>, who throughout has unflinchingly and, in the main, good
humouredly, borne the brunt of battle. The flesh is weak,
especially when there is a good deal of it, and the thermometer
stands at 82° in the shade. The <span class="smcap">Squire</span> has snapped occasionally,
<span class="smcap">Jokim&#39;s</span> apologetic figure, upright at opposite side of table, proving
unfailing, irresistible, incentive. Even worse to bear have been the
desertion of a few followers and the importunity of many. Had the
<span class="smcap">Squire</span> been a weaker man, he would long ago have brought the
Closure to bear on obstruction, and there would have followed a
state of irritation, amid which, if Budget was not wrecked, it would
have appropriated the whole time of an extended Session. The
<span class="smcap">Squire</span>, going on another tack, has worn out obstruction by affecting
the virtue of urbanity if he had it not.</p>

<p class="indent">It was particularly hard lines, after getting Clause XXVII. through
last Wednesday with a majority of over half a hundred, to be compelled
to recommit Bill, in order that <span class="smcap">Clancy</span> might chortle, and
<span class="smcap">Redmond</span> rage. <span class="smcap">Squire</span> advised to resist; condemned from his own
side when he yielded. But what happened? At quarter past ten
to-night Bill recommitted in respect of this clause, and on stroke of
midnight the whole thing was done with.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We Liberals,&quot; said the Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, &quot;always know better
than our leaders. As there are many of us, and as we each take our
individual view, result somewhat chaotic. Good thing if in comparative
leisure of week end we think over how the Budget Bill was
passed, and what would have happened if we had worried the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>
into going one of our diverse ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Enter the apothecary. It was Cap&#39;en <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span>
who brought him on. The last person in any one&#39;s mind. House in
Committee on Army Estimates; <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> to the fore. Bound to
live up to the 534 speeches he made and questions he put last year.
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> then beat him by fourteen, and promises to be equally ahead
in the current Session. The <span class="smcap">Cap&#39;en</span> hitherto had peculiar advantage,
seeing that for many weeks he has been, so to speak, cruising in
home waters. Having been brought up on legacy tax, teethed on
death duties, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> surprised himself and the House with the
command he displayed over intricacies of Budget Bill. <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span>
then fell behind. Now, with House in Committee on Army Estimates,
he can show <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> a clean pair of heels, a spectacle in which that
eminent and able Marine may or may not take keen personal
interest.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> began at once raising point of order; <span class="smcap">Mellor</span> ruled him
out like a shot; so went off on another tack. Adventured the
startlingly novel proposition that &quot;promotion should be by merit.&quot;
Enlarged on the theme for twenty minutes; sat down only when he
concluded that audience had fully mastered the proposition, contemplation
of which was new to their bewildered mind.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at this stage <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> towed in the apothecary. He appeared
on the scene quite as abruptly as <i>Romeo&#39;s</i> acquaintance in the streets
of Mantua:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I do remember an apothecary,</p>
<p>And hereabout he dwells.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cap&#39;en</span> omitted details; but House gathered that his friend the
apothecary was, like <i>Romeo&#39;s</i>, meagre of looks, worn to the bones by
sharp misery. This condition engendered by circumstance that he
had been brooding in his needy shop, among the green earthen pots,
bladders, and musty seeds, remnants of packthread and old cakes of
roses, upon fact that whilst there are surgeon-majors in the Army,
there are no apothecary-majors. On behalf of his absent friend,
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> demanded an explanation from <span class="smcap">Secretary of State for
War</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span> with the ruthless disregard of Shaksperian
traditions that seems to suit the War Office, said &quot;apothecaries are
an expiring class,&quot; a way of putting it that suggested they had been
dosing themselves. Their place was now filled by non-commissioned
officers, who were called compounders of medicine.</p>

<p class="indent">What a fall is here. Fancy <i>Romeo</i> going about the moonlit
streets of Mantua calling out, &quot;What ho! Compounder of Medicine.&quot;
This callous remark had such effect on Cap&#39;en <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> that he laid
aside his speaking-trumpet, and was heard, no more through the live-long
night. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Some Votes in Army Estimates.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Looked in after dinner just now; startled to find
<span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> on his legs, with bit of dirty white rag held out in
both hands towards Treasury Bench. Not many Members present;
those on Liberal side vociferously cheering. <span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>
looking in better temper even than usual; which was strange since
Committee on Army Estimates been at it since four o&#39;clock, and only
one vote passed. <span class="smcap">Woodall</span>, only other occupant of Treasury Bench,
been shewing how a man may smile and smile, and be a Financial
Secretary to the War Office. Now the smile broadens till it stretches
almost full length of Treasury Bench. As <span class="smcap">Sark</span> says, it justifies
<span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling&#39;s</span> bold imagery of <span class="smcap">Bobs</span> sitting on a bucking
charger,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>With a smile round both yer ears,</p>
<p class="i2">Ain&#39;t ye Bobs?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Causton</span> just bustled in, holding telegram at arm&#39;s length. It is
the reading of this that has broken the monotony of Committee with
noise of cheering, and dashed a smile along the Ministerial benches
like a sudden flash of sunlight. Only for this merry mood, one
entering the House at this particular moment might fear the worst.
<span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> been at it hour after hour since Tuesday, when House got
into Committee on Navy Estimates. <span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>, a
person of imperturbable temper. But there are limits to human
endurance; now they seem to have been reached. This telegram
<span class="smcap">Causton</span> has brought in and handed to War Minister doubtless
announces that all is ready; a file of soldiers waits on the Terrace;
<span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> will be seized, bound, carried forth, blindfolded, shot;
and then the Committee will really get to business, and vote Supply.</p>

<p class="indent">A sad fate for one only moderately middle-aged. <i>Tu l&#39;as voulu</i>
<span class="smcap">Robert William</span>. Still, cannot withhold the tear of pity as the
hapless man stands clutching at the extended white flag which
announces his capitulation, his entreaty for pardon, his promise of
better conduct in future.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Ask <span class="smcap">Sark</span> if he won&#39;t say something for
the doomed man. <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, in language not to
be here repeated, explains that things are
not what they seem. Fact is, <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> has
somewhere obtained (in what manner, <span class="smcap">Sark</span>
hints, may be matter for police inquiry) a
portion of sheeting, the property of <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span>, supplied to soldiers. This he has
brought down, intending to confound <span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>.
Happened to bring it
out just at the moment when news arrived
of a great Liberal victory snatched at the
polls at Attercliffe. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Two votes in Army
Estimates.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Lords, Friday.</i>&mdash;Peers not
habitually given to tears. To-night the
<span class="smcap">Markiss</span> plunged them (especially Ministers)
into condition of abject woe. Only said
that England was the head-quarters of the
Anarchist operations, the laboratory in
which all their contrivances were hatched.
<span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> jumped at opportunity with intuition
of Old Parliamentary Hand. Enlarged
upon it with skill of born debater.
<span class="smcap">Markiss</span> saw his mistake. Hadn&#39;t meant
anything; only his way of putting a case.
But here was <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> pitilessly making
it clear how the Leader of the Patriot
Party had given his country away to the
Paris gossips; how he had assumed a state
of things which, set forth on authority of
ex-Prime Minister and ex-Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, would be made much
of by the enemy abroad.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Markiss</span> for once so singed by his own
blazing indiscretion that he did not wait for
<span class="smcap">Schomberg Macdonnell&#39;s</span> convenient correspondent,
but forthwith endeavoured to
explain away his remarks. This led only
to tears coursing more rapidly down <span class="smcap">Rosebery&#39;s</span>
pained face, whilst <span class="smcap">Spencer</span> forlornly
shook his beard as if it were the flag of
England drooping under the shamed skies,
and <span class="smcap">Kimberley</span> dolefully dropped his head.
A pretty scene, admirably staged and acted.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
